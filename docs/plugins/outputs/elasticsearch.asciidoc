=== elasticsearch



This output lets you store logs in Elasticsearch and is the most recommended
output for Logstash. If you plan on using the Kibana web interface, you'll
want to use this output.

This output only speaks the HTTP, which is the preferred protocol for interacting with Elasticsearch. By default
Elasticsearch exposes HTTP on port 9200.

We strongly encourage the use of HTTP over the node protocol. It is just as
fast and far easier to administer. For those wishing to use the java protocol please see the 'elasticsearch_java' gem.

You can learn more about Elasticsearch at <https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch>

==== Retry Policy

By default all bulk requests to ES are synchronous. Not all events in the bulk requests
always make it successfully. For example, there could be events which are not formatted
correctly for the index they are targeting (type mismatch in mapping). So that we minimize loss of 
events, we have a specific retry policy in place. We retry all events which fail to be reached by 
Elasticsearch for network related issues. We retry specific events which exhibit errors under a separate 
policy described below. Events of this nature are ones which experience ES error codes described as 
retryable errors.

*Retryable Errors:*

- 429, Too Many Requests (RFC6585)
- 503, The server is currently unable to handle the request due to a temporary overloading or maintenance of the server.

Here are the rules of what is retried when:

- Block and retry all events in bulk response that experiences transient network exceptions until
  a successful submission is received by Elasticsearch.
- Retry subset of sent events which resulted in ES errors of a retryable nature which can be found 
  in RETRYABLE_CODES
- For events which returned retryable error codes, they will be pushed onto a separate queue for 
  retrying events. events in this queue will be retried a maximum of 5 times by default (configurable through :max_retries). The size of 
  this queue is capped by the value set in :retry_max_items.
- Events from the retry queue are submitted again either when the queue reaches its max size or when
  the max interval time is reached, which is set in :retry_max_interval.
- Events which are not retryable or have reached their max retry count are logged to stderr.

==== Details

&nbsp;

[[plugins-outputs-elasticsearch-action]]
===== `action` 

  * Value can be any of: `index`, `delete`, `create`, `update`
  * Default value is `"index"`

The Elasticsearch action to perform. Valid actions are: `index`, `delete`.

Use of this setting *REQUIRES* you also configure the `document_id` setting
because `delete` actions all require a document id.

What does each action do?

- index: indexes a document (an event from Logstash).
- delete: deletes a document by id
- create: indexes a document, fails if a document by that id already exists in the index.
- update: updates a document by id
following action is not supported by HTTP protocol

For more details on actions, check out the http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docs-bulk.html[Elasticsearch bulk API documentation]

[[plugins-outputs-elasticsearch-cacert]]
===== `cacert` 

  * Value type is <<path,path>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

The .cer or .pem file to validate the server's certificate

[[plugins-outputs-elasticsearch-codec]]
===== `codec` 

  * Value type is <<codec,codec>>
  * Default value is `"plain"`

The codec used for output data. Output codecs are a convenient method for encoding your data before it leaves the output, without needing a separate filter in your Logstash pipeline.

[[plugins-outputs-elasticsearch-doc_as_upsert]]
===== `doc_as_upsert` 

  * Value type is <<boolean,boolean>>
  * Default value is `false`

Enable doc_as_upsert for update mode
create a new document with source if document_id doesn't exists

[[plugins-outputs-elasticsearch-document_id]]
===== `document_id` 

  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

The document ID for the index. Useful for overwriting existing entries in
Elasticsearch with the same ID.

[[plugins-outputs-elasticsearch-document_type]]
===== `document_type` 

  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

The document type to write events to. Generally you should try to write only
similar events to the same 'type'. String expansion `%{foo}` works here.
Unless you set 'document_type', the event 'type' will be used if it exists 
otherwise the document type will be assigned the value of 'logs'

[[plugins-outputs-elasticsearch-exclude_tags]]
===== `exclude_tags`  (DEPRECATED)

  * DEPRECATED WARNING: This configuration item is deprecated and may not be available in future versions.
  * Value type is <<array,array>>
  * Default value is `[]`

Only handle events without any of these tags.
Optional.

[[plugins-outputs-elasticsearch-flush_size]]
===== `flush_size` 

  * Value type is <<number,number>>
  * Default value is `500`

This plugin uses the bulk index api for improved indexing performance.
To make efficient bulk api calls, we will buffer a certain number of
events before flushing that out to Elasticsearch. This setting
controls how many events will be buffered before sending a batch
of events.

[[plugins-outputs-elasticsearch-hosts]]
===== `hosts` 

  * Value type is <<array,array>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

Sets the host(s) of the remote instance. If given an array it will load balance requests across the hosts specified in the `host` parameter.
Remember the `http` protocol uses the http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-http.html#modules-http[http] address (eg. 9200, not 9300).
    `"127.0.0.1"`
    `["127.0.0.1:9200","127.0.0.2:9200"]`
It is important to exclude http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-node.html[dedicated master nodes] from the `host` list
to prevent LS from sending bulk requests to the master nodes.  So this parameter should only reference either data or client nodes.

[[plugins-outputs-elasticsearch-idle_flush_time]]
===== `idle_flush_time` 

  * Value type is <<number,number>>
  * Default value is `1`

The amount of time since last flush before a flush is forced.

This setting helps ensure slow event rates don't get stuck in Logstash.
For example, if your `flush_size` is 100, and you have received 10 events,
and it has been more than `idle_flush_time` seconds since the last flush,
Logstash will flush those 10 events automatically.

This helps keep both fast and slow log streams moving along in
near-real-time.

[[plugins-outputs-elasticsearch-index]]
===== `index` 

  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * Default value is `"logstash-%{+YYYY.MM.dd}"`

The index to write events to. This can be dynamic using the `%{foo}` syntax.
The default value will partition your indices by day so you can more easily
delete old data or only search specific date ranges.
Indexes may not contain uppercase characters.
For weekly indexes ISO 8601 format is recommended, eg. logstash-%{+xxxx.ww}

[[plugins-outputs-elasticsearch-index_type]]
===== `index_type`  (DEPRECATED)

  * DEPRECATED WARNING: This configuration item is deprecated and may not be available in future versions.
  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

The index type to write events to. Generally you should try to write only
similar events to the same 'type'. String expansion `%{foo}` works here.

Deprecated in favor of `document_type` field.

[[plugins-outputs-elasticsearch-keystore]]
===== `keystore` 

  * Value type is <<path,path>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

===== `manage_template` 

  * Value type is <<boolean,boolean>>
  * Default value is `true`

a default mapping template for Elasticsearch will be applied, if you do not
already have one set to match the index pattern defined (default of
`logstash-%{+YYYY.MM.dd}`), minus any variables.  For example, in this case
the template will be applied to all indices starting with `logstash-*`

If you have dynamic templating (e.g. creating indices based on field names)
then you should set `manage_template` to false and use the REST API to upload
your templates manually.

[[plugins-outputs-elasticsearch-max_retries]]
===== `max_retries` 

  * Value type is <<number,number>>
  * Default value is `3`

Set max retry for each event

[[plugins-outputs-elasticsearch-routing]]
===== `routing` 

  * Value type is <<string,string>>
